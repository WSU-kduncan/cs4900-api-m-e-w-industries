# NOTES ON HW2

- I went way farther ahead than the assignment asked for
- I will not apologize for that because it's been a lot of fun working on this
- this is the first actual coding I've done at WSU since I transferred here from Sinclair, so I'm not gonna be chill about it

## ABOUT DTO MAPPING

<p>I could not get DtoMapper classes to comply with our Rel tables, and in my troubleshooting the only way
I could get the API to correctly map entities and classes was by including some specific Queries
in the repository classes, and doing a lot of conversions inside the Dto classes. I left the logic of
my DtoMapper classes in tact, just commented them all out.</p>
