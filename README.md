### Notes

<p>I worked ahead again this week but I won't apologize for it, programming is too much fun. I had to alter the foreign keys
of our relational tables to cascade deletes, and that DDL can be found in `/MEWdemo/SQL/AlterConstraintsDDL.sql`. I also added it
to out init_MEW_GM_DB.sql file in `/MEWdemo/db/`.</p>
